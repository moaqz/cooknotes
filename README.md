## Motivation

I'm exploring the world of pastry and wanted a place to store all my recipes without needing to register or rely on paid services. This led me to build a desktop application based on the philosophy [file over app](https://stephango.com/file-over-app), and why not, try a new technology **(Tauri)**.
